- **Ingress** it rules for load blancer (Nginx) inside kubernetes cluster, it proxy traffic depending on given host rules
- **Service** it is an abstraction for network access to deployment (define http ports)
- **Deployment** it is an abstraction for create and manage pods (which are a group of docker containers)
- **Cronjob*** it is an abstraction to run pods on a schedule
- **Configmaps** it is an abstraction for store configs and settings variebles for your service
- **Secrets** it is an abstraction for store sensitive information for your application

## Deploy

First before start any of this commands, read config for your env!!!

``` source $(./scripts/read_config.sh ./configs/env/<env_name>/) ```

- If you need render k8s manifest and deploy they run: `./scripts/k8s/deploy_apps.bash deploy`
- If you need only render manifest run: `./scripts/k8s/deploy_apps.bash render_templates`
- another availeble commands:
    - deploy_configs
    - deploy_secret
    - deploy_deployment
    - deploy_cronjob
    - deploy_service
    - deploy_ingress
    - deploy_certificate
    - deploy_global 


## Backend service configuration and how to add new service

Each service must be defined in env.svc_config map in configs/env/svc.yaml

Example:

```
env:
  svc_config:
    cms:
      deploy: true # Set it to false if you don't want to deploy this service in this env
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 500M
          cpu: 500m
        requests:
          memory: 200M
          cpu: 100m
    ...
```

Also if this service has api you must add subdomain to dns array in configs/env/dns.yaml

Example:
```
env:
  dns:
    domains:
      auth0: "auth-api-{{ env.name }}.{{ env.project.domain }}"
```

Than it has main config for this service in configs/global/<service_name>.yaml

Example:

```
# Global Config
settings:
  deploy: {{ env.svc_config.farm_api.deploy }}
  replicas: 1
  pod_update_version: 1 # Increment this if you want upgrade pod

  docs: false

  resources: {{ env.svc_config.farm_api.resources | default(env.k8s.apps.defaults.resources) }}

  db_proxy:
    enable: true
    instance: "{{ env.db.databases.app.instance }}"

  ports:
    api: 8085

  ingress:
    routes:
      "{{ env.dns.domains.farm }}":
        paths:
          - port: 8085

  helthcheck:
    enable: true
    path: /healthcheck
    host: "{{ env.dns.domains.farm }}"

  configmap: # TODO: Set values
    PORT: 8085
    DEBUG: 1

  env:
    - name: DEBUG
    - name: PORT

    - name: DB_DATABASE
      from: db
    - name: DB_HOST
      from: db
    - name: DB_PASSWORD
      from: db
      secret: true
    - name: DB_USER
      secret: true
      from: db
    - name: DB_PORT
      from: db

    - name: AUTH_SERVER
      from: services-cfg
      key: USER
```

about must important fileds:
- `replicas number` of pods for this deployment
- `pod_update_version` this varible using for update pods when we change some varibles in configmaps, (kubernetes by default don't update pods if we update configmap)
- `docs` set it to true if this service have swagger doc inside docker image, it's generate separate container in this pod for serve this doc
- `db_proxy` set it to true if this service need connect to sql database
- `helthcheck` configure liveness and readyness probes for pod
- `configmap` this generate separate configmap for this service
- `env` here you define env variebles for your service

By default it use varibles from service configmap, but you can connect configmaps from another services

For example:
```
- name: AUTH_SERVER
  from: services-cfg
  key: USER
```

this read value of varible USER from services-cfg configmap and put it to AUTH_SERVER env varible

You also can use secrets for store sensetive varibles:
```
secret:
  PASSWORD: test
  
- name: SECRET_PASSWORD
  secret: true
  key: PASSWORD
```

key and secret this not required options, by default key=name and secret=false.
